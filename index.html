            The app aims to provide an interactive and entertaining way of learning musical terms and notation.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            It’s really hard to find teaching materials for children that aren’t boring, unimaginative books - often
            focusing on function more than form. But the facts show that children will not engage with learning materials in
            a productive way without catering to their developing minds.

                “Years ago when I was learning the basics of music like symbols and notation, I found the process really
                monotonous and that really put a stop to feeling good about reading music from the sheet. I started
                ‘ear-reading’ as they call it, and my efficiency when learning new pieces suffered as a result.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                So I started thinking about more engaging ways to memorise the boring stuff and I thought, “A lot more children
                these days have smartphones, tablets and other devices than when I was learning… Why not make an app?”.”
